If you set it to PATH, the user will see the absolute Amazon S3 bucket or EFS paths as is in their file transfer protocol clients. If you set it LOGICAL, you need to provide mappings in the HomeDirectoryMappings for how you want to make Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS paths visible to your users.
  --home-directory-mappings: list # Logical directory mappings that specify what Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS paths and keys should be visible to your user and how you want to make them visible. You must specify the Entry and Target pair, where Entry shows how the path is made visible and Target is the actual Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS path. If you only specify a target, it is displayed as is. You also must ensure that your Identity and Access Management (IAM) role provides access to paths in Target. This value can be set only when HomeDirectoryType is set to LOGICAL. The following is an Entry and Target pair example. [ { "Entry": "/directory1", "Target": "/bucket_name/home/mydirectory" } ] In most cases, you can use this value instead of the session policy to lock down your user to the designated home directory ("chroot"). To do this, you can set Entry to / and set Target to the HomeDirectory parameter value. The following is an Entry and Target pair example for chroot.

Variables that you can use inside this policy include ${Transfer:UserName}, ${Transfer:HomeDirectory}, and ${Transfer:HomeBucket}. This policy applies only when the domain of ServerId is Amazon S3. Amazon EFS does not use session policies. For session policies, Transfer Family stores the policy as a JSON blob, instead of the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the policy. You save the policy as a JSON blob and pass it in the Policy argument. For an example of a session policy, see Example session policy (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transfer/latest/userguide/session-policy.html).

# Creates an agreement. An agreement is a bilateral trading partner agreement, or partnership, between an Transfer Family server and an AS2 process. The agreement defines the file and message transfer relationship between the server and the AS2 process. To define an agreement, Transfer Family combines a server, local profile, partner profile, certificate, and other attributes. The partner is identified with the PartnerProfileId, and the AS2 process is identified with the LocalProfileId.

  --endpoint-type: string@endpoint-type-completer # The type of endpoint that you want your server to use. You can choose to make your server's endpoint publicly accessible (PUBLIC) or host it inside your VPC. With an endpoint that is hosted in a VPC, you can restrict access to your server and resources only within your VPC or choose to make it internet facing by attaching Elastic IP addresses directly to it. After May 19, 2021, you won't be able to create a server using EndpointType=VPC_ENDPOINT in your Amazon Web Services account if your account hasn't already done so before May 19, 2021. If you have already created servers with EndpointType=VPC_ENDPOINT in your Amazon Web Services account on or before May 19, 2021, you will not be affected. After this date, use EndpointType=VPC. For more information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transfer/latest/userguide/create-server-in-vpc.html#deprecate-vpc-endpoint. It is recommended that you use VPC as the EndpointType. With this endpoint type, you have the option to directly associate up to three Elastic IPv4 addresses (BYO IP included) with your server's endpoint and use VPC security groups to restrict traffic by the client's public IP address. This is not possible with EndpointType set to VPC_ENDPOINT.
  --host-key: string # The RSA, ECDSA, or ED25519 private key to use for your SFTP-enabled server.

Use the following command to generate an RSA 2048 bit key with no passphrase: ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -N "" -m PEM -f my-new-server-key. Use a minimum value of 2048 for the -b option. You can create a stronger key by using 3072 or 4096. Use the following command to generate an ECDSA 256 bit key with no passphrase: ssh-keygen -t ecdsa -b 256 -N "" -m PEM -f my-new-server-key. Valid values for the -b option for ECDSA are 256, 384, and 521. Use the following command to generate an ED25519 key with no passphrase: ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -N "" -f my-new-server-key. For all of these commands, you can replace my-new-server-key with a string of your choice. If you aren't planning to migrate existing users from an existing SFTP-enabled server to a new server, don't update the host key. Accidentally changing a server's host key can be disruptive. For more information, see Manage host keys for your SFTP-enabled server (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transfer/latest/userguide/edit-server-config.html#configuring-servers-change-host-key) in the Transfer Family User Guide.

If Protocol includes either FTP or FTPS, then the EndpointType must be VPC and the IdentityProviderType must be either AWS_DIRECTORY_SERVICE, AWS_LAMBDA, or API_GATEWAY. If Protocol includes FTP, then AddressAllocationIds cannot be associated. If Protocol is set only to SFTP, the EndpointType can be set to PUBLIC and the IdentityProviderType can be set any of the supported identity types: SERVICE_MANAGED, AWS_DIRECTORY_SERVICE, AWS_LAMBDA, or API_GATEWAY.

The following is an Entry and Target pair example. [ { "Entry": "/directory1", "Target": "/bucket_name/home/mydirectory" } ] In most cases, you can use this value instead of the session policy to lock your user down to the designated home directory ("chroot").

For ECDSA keys, the key type is either ecdsa-sha2-nistp256, ecdsa-sha2-nistp384, or ecdsa-sha2-nistp521, depending on the size of the key you generated.

The following is an Entry and Target pair example. [ { "Entry": "/directory1", "Target": "/bucket_name/home/mydirectory" } ] In most cases, you can use this value instead of the session policy to lock down your user to the designated home directory ("chroot"). To do this, you can set Entry to / and set Target to the HomeDirectory parameter value. The following is an Entry and Target pair example for chroot.

You can create a stronger key by using 3072 or 4096. Use the following command to generate an ECDSA 256 bit key with no passphrase: ssh-keygen -t ecdsa -b 256 -N "" -m PEM -f my-new-server-key. Valid values for the -b option for ECDSA are 256, 384, and 521. Use the following command to generate an ED25519 key with no passphrase: ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -N "" -f my-new-server-key. For all of these commands, you can replace my-new-server-key with a string of your choice. If you aren't planning to migrate existing users from an existing SFTP-enabled server to a new server, don't update the host key. Accidentally changing a server's host key can be disruptive.

  --logging-role: string # The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that allows a server to turn on Amazon CloudWatch logging for Amazon S3 or Amazon EFSevents. When set, you can view user activity in your CloudWatch logs.
  --post-authentication-login-banner: string # Specifies a string to display when users connect to a server. This string is displayed after the user authenticates. The SFTP protocol does not support post-authentication display banners.
  --pre-authentication-login-banner: string # Specifies a string to display when users connect to a server. This string is displayed before the user authenticates. For example, the following banner displays details about using the system: This system is for the use of authorized users only. Individuals using this computer system without authority, or in excess of their authority, are subject to having all of their activities on this system monitored and recorded by system personnel.
  --protocols: list<string> # Specifies the file transfer protocol or protocols over which your file transfer protocol client can connect to your server's endpoint. The available protocols are: SFTP (Secure Shell (SSH) File Transfer Protocol): File transfer over SSH FTPS (File Transfer Protocol Secure): File transfer with TLS encryption FTP (File Transfer Protocol): Unencrypted file transfer AS2 (Applicability Statement 2): used for transporting structured business-to-business data If you select FTPS, you must choose a certificate stored in Certificate Manager (ACM) which is used to identify your server when clients connect to it over FTPS. If Protocol includes either FTP or FTPS, then the EndpointType must be VPC and the IdentityProviderType must be either AWS_DIRECTORY_SERVICE, AWS_LAMBDA, or API_GATEWAY. If Protocol includes FTP, then AddressAllocationIds cannot be associated. If Protocol is set only to SFTP, the EndpointType can be set to PUBLIC and the IdentityProviderType can be set any of the supported identity types: SERVICE_MANAGED, AWS_DIRECTORY_SERVICE, AWS_LAMBDA, or API_GATEWAY. If Protocol includes AS2, then the EndpointType must be VPC, and domain must be Amazon S3.

  --home-directory-type: string@home-directory-type-completer # The type of landing directory (folder) that you want your users' home directory to be when they log in to the server. If you set it to PATH, the user will see the absolute Amazon S3 bucket or EFS paths as is in their file transfer protocol clients. If you set it LOGICAL, you need to provide mappings in the HomeDirectoryMappings for how you want to make Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS paths visible to your users.
  --home-directory-mappings: list # Logical directory mappings that specify what Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS paths and keys should be visible to your user and how you want to make them visible. You must specify the Entry and Target pair, where Entry shows how the path is made visible and Target is the actual Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS path. If you only specify a target, it is displayed as is. You also must ensure that your Identity and Access Management (IAM) role provides access to paths in Target. This value can be set only when HomeDirectoryType is set to LOGICAL. The following is an Entry and Target pair example. [ { "Entry": "/directory1", "Target": "/bucket_name/home/mydirectory" } ] In most cases, you can use this value instead of the session policy to lock down your user to the designated home directory ("chroot"). To do this, you can set Entry to '/' and set Target to the HomeDirectory parameter value. The following is an Entry and Target pair example for chroot. [ { "Entry": "/", "Target": "/bucket_name/home/mydirectory" } ] — item shape: {Entry: string, Target: string}
  --policy: string # A session policy for your user so that you can use the same Identity and Access Management (IAM) role across multiple users. This policy scopes down a user's access to portions of their Amazon S3 bucket. Variables that you can use inside this policy include ${Transfer:UserName}, ${Transfer:HomeDirectory}, and ${Transfer:HomeBucket}. This policy applies only when the domain of ServerId is Amazon S3. Amazon EFS does not use session policies. For session policies, Transfer Family stores the policy as a JSON blob, instead of the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the policy. You save the policy as a JSON blob and pass it in the Policy argument. For an example of a session policy, see Creating a session policy (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transfer/latest/userguide/session-policy). For more information, see AssumeRole (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_AssumeRole.html) in the Amazon Web Services Security Token Service API Reference.

For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.  An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.  Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.  The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).  #Safety  Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.  Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).  When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.  #Built In Filters  The following filters are built in:  default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers). withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields none, which is empty total, which includes just .total  #Compatibility with V1.x  For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in.

With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).  #Safety  Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.  Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).  When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.  #Built In Filters  The following filters are built in:  default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers). withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields none, which is empty total, which includes just .total  #Compatibility with V1.x  For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in.

# Passing valid access_tokens to this method causes the application that created them to be de-authorized by the user associated with each access_token. This will remove the application from their apps tab, and cause all other existing access_tokens to be destroyed.   This method is meant for uninstalling applications, recovering from access_token leaks, or simply as a stronger form of /access-tokens/{accessTokens}/invalidate.   Nothing prevents a user from re-authenticate to an application that has de-authenticated itself, the user will be prompted to approve the application again however.   {accessTokens} can contain up to 20 access tokens. These are obtained by authenticating a user using OAuth 2.0.   This method returns a list of access_tokens.

For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.  An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.  Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.  The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).  #Safety  Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.  Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).  When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.  #Built In Filters  The following filters are built in:  default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers). withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields none, which is empty total, which includes just .total  #Compatibility with V1.x  For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0. New applications should not use these filters.

This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.  #Built In Filters  The following filters are built in:  default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers). withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields none, which is empty total, which includes just .total  #Compatibility with V1.x  For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0.

The API considers the following "events":  - posting a question  - posting an answer  - posting a comment  - editing a post  - creating a user        Events are only accessible for 15 minutes after they occurred, and by default only events in the last 5 minutes are returned.

For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.  An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.  Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.  The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).  #Safety  Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.  Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).  When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request.

# Creates a new filter given a list of includes, excludes, a base filter, and whether or not this filter should be "unsafe".   Filter "safety" is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.   If no base filter is specified, the default filter is assumed. When building a filter from scratch, the none built-in filter is useful.   When the size of the parameters being sent to this method grows to large, problems can occur. This method will accept POST requests to mitigate this.   It is not expected that many applications will call this method at runtime, filters should be pre-calculated and "baked in" in the common cases. Furthermore, there are a number of built-in filters which cover common use cases.   This method returns a single filter.

For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.  An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.  Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.  The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).  #Safety  Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.  Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).  When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.  #Built In Filters  The following filters are built in:  default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers). withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields none, which is empty total, which includes just .total  #Compatibility with V1.x  For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in.

An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.  Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.  The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).  #Safety  Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.  Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).  When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.  #Built In Filters  The following filters are built in:  default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers). withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields none, which is empty total, which includes just .total  #Compatibility with V1.x  For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0. New applications should not use these filters.

# Returns a record of merges that have occurred involving a user identified by an access_token.   This method allows you to take now invalid account ids and find what account they've become, or take currently valid account ids and find which ids were equivalent in the past.   This is most useful when confirming that an account_id is in fact "new" to an application.   Account merges can happen for a wide range of reasons, applications should not make assumptions that merges have particular causes.   Note that accounts are managed at a network level, users on a site may be merged due to an account level merge but there is no guarantee that a merge has an effect on any particular site.   This method returns a list of account_merge.

For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.  An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.  Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.  The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).  #Safety  Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.  Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).  When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.  #Built In Filters  The following filters are built in:  default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers). withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields none, which is empty total, which includes just .total  #Compatibility with V1.x  For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in.

Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.  Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).  When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.  #Built In Filters  The following filters are built in:  default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers). withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields none, which is empty total, which includes just .total  #Compatibility with V1.x  For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0. New applications should not use these filters.

For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.  An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.  Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.  The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).  #Safety  Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.  Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).  When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.  #Built In Filters  The following filters are built in:  default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers). withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields none, which is empty total, which includes just .total  #Compatibility with V1.x  For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in.

For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.  An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.  Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.  The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).  #Safety  Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.  Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).  When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.  #Built In Filters  The following filters are built in:  default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers). withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields none, which is empty total, which includes just .total  #Compatibility with V1.x  For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in.

# Gets all the questions on the site.   This method allows you make fairly flexible queries across the entire corpus of questions on a site. For example, getting all questions asked in the the week of Jan 1st 2011 with scores of 10 or more is a single query with parameters sort=votes&min=10&fromdate=1293840000&todate=1294444800.   To constrain questions returned to those with a set of tags, use the tagged parameter with a semi-colon delimited list of tags. This is an and contraint, passing tagged=c;java will return only those questions with both tags. As such, passing more than 5 tags will always return zero results.   The sorts accepted by this method operate on the follow fields of the question object:  - activity - last_activity_date  - creation - creation_date  - votes - score  - hot - by the formula ordering the hot tab Does not accept min or max  - week - by the formula ordering the week tab Does not accept min or max  - month - by the formula ordering the month tab Does not accept min or max   activity is the default sort.    It is possible to create moderately complex queries using sort, min, max, fromdate, and todate.    This method returns a list of questions.

Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter.

When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request.

# Gets questions which link to those questions identified in {ids}.   This method only considers questions that are linked within a site, and will never return questions from another Stack Exchange site.   A question is considered "linked" when it explicitly includes a hyperlink to another question, there are no other heuristics.   {ids} can contain up to 100 semicolon delimited ids, to find ids programatically look for question_id on question objects.   The sorts accepted by this method operate on the follow fields of the question object:  - activity - last_activity_date  - creation - creation_date  - votes - score  - rank - a priority sort by site applies, subject to change at any time Does not accept min or max   activity is the default sort.    It is possible to create moderately complex queries using sort, min, max, fromdate, and todate.    This method returns a list of questions.

For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.  An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.  Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.  The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).  #Safety  Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.  Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).  When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form.

# Returns questions which are similar to a hypothetical one based on a title and tag combination.   This method is roughly equivalent to a site's related questions suggestion on the ask page.   This method is useful for correlating data outside of a Stack Exchange site with similar content within one.   Note that title must always be passed as a parameter. tagged and nottagged are optional, semi-colon delimited lists of tags.   If tagged is passed it is treated as a preference, there is no guarantee that questions returned will have any of those tags. nottagged is treated as a requirement, no questions will be returned with those tags.   The sorts accepted by this method operate on the follow fields of the question object:  - activity - last_activity_date  - creation - creation_date  - votes - score  - relevance - order by "how similar" the questions are, most likely candidate first with a descending order Does not accept min or max   activity is the default sort.    It is possible to create moderately complex queries using sort, min, max, fromdate, and todate.    This method returns a list of questions.

# Returns all sites in the network.   This method allows for discovery of new sites, and changes to existing ones. Be aware that unlike normal API methods, this method should be fetched very infrequently, it is very unusual for these values to change more than once on any given day. It is suggested that you cache its return for at least one day, unless your app encounters evidence that it has changed (such as from the /info method).   The pagesize parameter for this method is unbounded, in acknowledgement that for many applications repeatedly fetching from /sites would complicate start-up tasks needlessly.

With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).  #Safety  Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.  Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).  When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.  #Built In Filters  The following filters are built in:  default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers). withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields none, which is empty total, which includes just .total  #Compatibility with V1.x  For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in.

For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.  An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.  Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.  The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).  #Safety  Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.  Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).  When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.  #Built In Filters  The following filters are built in:  default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers). withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields none, which is empty total, which includes just .total  #Compatibility with V1.x  For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in.

Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).  #Safety  Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.  Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).  When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.  #Built In Filters  The following filters are built in:  default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers). withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields none, which is empty total, which includes just .total  #Compatibility with V1.x  For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in.

For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.  An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.  Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.  The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).  #Safety  Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.  Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).  When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request.

For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.  An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.  Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.  The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).  #Safety  Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.

For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.  An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.  Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.  The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).  #Safety  Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.  Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).  When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.  #Built In Filters  The following filters are built in:  default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers). withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields none, which is empty total, which includes just .total  #Compatibility with V1.x  For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0. New applications should not use these filters.

# Returns the write permissions a user has via the api.   The Stack Exchange API gives users the ability to create, edit, and delete certain types. This method returns whether the passed user is capable of performing those actions at all, as well as how many times a day they can.   This method does not consider the user's current quota (ie. if they've already exhausted it for today) nor any additional restrictions on write access, such as editing deleted comments.   This method returns a list of write_permissions.
